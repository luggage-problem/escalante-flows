# escalante-flows

## Goals:
 - Determine the best 5 day interval to do the float in question (meaning of best tbd)
    - target flows: supposed minimum 10-30cfm, 0.7 known minimum
 - Test model on test years (test years tbd)
 - Potentially generalize to other trips

## data we need:
 - historical usgs gauge data data for escalante (09337500) + more in basin?
 - snotel SWE historical data
 - watershed data?
 - temp/precip climatology?
 
## SDK's:
 - https://github.com/USGS-python/dataretrieval ?
